## Overview

This class is designed as an introduction to programming for the undergraduate physics major. The class begins with no assumption of prior programming experience. An emphasis will be on building strong programming skills, beginning with the Julia programming language. Applications and examples will include data analysis (curve fitting and optimization), simulating physical systems, solving systems of linear equations and Monte Carlo techniques. We will explore other languages and concepts as the class progresses including Python and using GitHub.

Most course materials will be provided in our GitHub Classroom organization. Each student must have a (free) GitHub account.

There is no required text for the class.

Personal laptops are recommended but not required during class. UNM has a laptop loan system. See [this flyer](LaptopCheckout%20Flyer.pdf).

This is a three credit-hour course. Class meets for two 75-minute sessions of direct instruction for fifteen weeks during the Spring 2025 semester. Please plan for a minimum of six hours of out-of-class work each week.

Audio and/or video recording during the class is prohibited unless requested through the Accessibility Resource Center.

Permissible use of AI tools will be explained on a case-by-case basis.

## Accommodations

UNM is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for students with documented disabilities. As your instructor, it is my objective to facilitate an inclusive classroom setting, in which students have full access and opportunity to participate. To engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations for this class and/or program, please contact Accessibility Resource Center at arcsrvs@unm.edu or by phone at 505-277-3506.

## Grading

Letter grades correspond with numerical scores as given by the scale at end of this section. Grades will be assigned based on the following:

### Homework (20%)

Weekly homework assignments will consist of problems that must be solved using Julia code. Each problem will be scored as 1 or 0 based on whether the code produces the exact correct result or not. I encourage students to study together and learn from each other as well as using AI learning tools. However, all homework must be created in its entirety by each student. Students must have full comprehension of any work they submit and may be asked to explain their code and solutions at any time. Evidence of copied homework will result in all involved students being dropped from the class. Assignments are due before 24:00 on the due date. No late assignments will be accepted.

The submission procedure will be via GitHub Classroom and will be explained further in class.

### Group Problems (5%)

Groups will be assigned by the instructor and will rotate throughout the semester. Within the group, students will rotate through group roles. Group roles will be discussed further in class. Each Group Problem Day will involve a short introduction to the problem by the instructor, a 35-minute block for each group to solve a multi-part problem, and a discussion of a working solution. Extra-credit can be achieved by completing additional or advanced work related to the problem.

### Group Quizzes (10%)

The Group Quizzes will be similar in format to the Group Problems, but problem solving will take the entire class period. To receive credit, a student must have been present for all prior Group Problems for that group. The group must also use group roles for the quiz, but groups can decide on their optimal group role configuration. The lowest scoring quiz of the semester will be dropped. No make-up quizzes will be offered.

### Individual Quizzes (25%)

Multiple quizzes will be given throughout the semester. The lowest scoring quiz of the semester will be dropped. No make-up quizzes will be offered.

### Midterm Exam (20%)

Details will be discussed in class.

### Final Project (20%)

Individual final projects are considered the final exam. Details will be discussed in class.

## University Policies and Student Support

### UAP 2720 and 2740 - Mutual Respect and Support

Our classroom and university should always be spaces of mutual respect, kindness, and support, without fear of discrimination, harassment, or violence. If you ever need assistance or have concerns about incidents that violate this principle, please access campus support resources. These include confidential services at:

- [LoboRESPECT Advocacy Center](https://loborespect.unm.edu/)
- [Women's Resource Center](https://women.unm.edu/)
- [LGBTQ Resource Center](http://lgbtqrc.unm.edu/)

The University of New Mexico prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (including gender, sex stereotyping, gender expression, and gender identity). UNM faculty and graduate teaching assistants are considered "responsible employees" and must [communicate reports](https://ceeo.unm.edu/reporting/how-do-i-report.html) of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence to [Compliance, Ethics and Equal Opportunity](https://ceeo.unm.edu/).

For more information on the campus policy regarding sexual misconduct, reporting, and reporting for "responsible employees," please see UAP 2720 and UAP 2740.
